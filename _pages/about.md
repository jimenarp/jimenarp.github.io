I am a PhD student in Economics at Cornell University. My research interests are in migration, labor economics, and development, with a focus on causal inference methods. I study how weather shocks shape migration decisions and labor markets, and how household members left behind adjust their education and labor supply. I also work on Bayesian methods for causal inference in aggregate settings.

Prior to transferring to Cornell, I was a visiting student at Yale University, was a PhD student at Stockholm University, and hold an MPA/ID from Harvard Kennedy School. I was a Research Fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank.
